 * Description: a class to provide a sortable linked list of Person classes. Pooh refrained
 * from coding one more linked list from scratch in his life. std::lsit is a doubly liked 
 * list at it's core and it is unlikely that great improvement can be done upon it's implementation.
 * 
 * The list does provide for it being laodable form a CSV file in order ot streamline the creation 
 * of big load testing
 * 
 * Clean Code Rules
